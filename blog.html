        <h2>The Birth of My Very Own Website!</h2>
        <p>
            Just like every other student, I had a LinkedIn. However, I was never satisfied with what LinkedIn allowed each user to put on their profile.
            My work and volunteer experience or education rarely defined and fully showed who I am. More than that, it is my hobbies that ultimately have 
            contributed the most into shaping the kind of person I am. I wanted to not only properly show my true self, but also share the works I have 
            invested so much love, effort, and time into over the years. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Thus, I began planning how to build my own website. I took Harvard's famous CS50 course in my freshman year of college where I was first introduced 
            to the world of coding. Although 2 years have passed since, I decided to refresh my memory and expand my knowledge of coding by attempting to code my 
            own website. I started relearning during Summe 2024 while attending Yonsei University's KLI program. Relearning the basic python and html 
            needed to build a simple website was relatively easy. However, finding resources and teaching myself how to elevate my 
            website in the way I wanted was not easy. After the start of Fall semester back at Yale, I barely had time to work on my website, but made an effort 
            to consistently improve something in my free time. 
            <br>
            <br>
            And before I knew it, I'm done! My website is published!
