        Corchet/Knitting
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        I started knitting in 5th grade after receiving a knitting kit from Santa Claus! I started with scarves, beanies, and clothes for my dog. In high school, I transitioned to crochet and made myself clothes and other home decor.

    <h2>
        Baking
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Just like many others, I picked up baking seriously during COVID. With my mother's birthday during the peak of COVID, I decided to surprise her with her favorite Korean-style cake as the area I lived in did not have many Asians or Asian goods. Since then, I started experimenting with other recipes while also researching the chemical background of baking to make my own recipes. The following is everything I have baked so far:
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh Strawberry Whipped Cream Cake</li>
            <li>Tiramisu Cake</li>
            <li>Italian Tiramisu Cake with Ladyfingers</li>
            <li>Chocolate Cake</li>
            <li>Carrot Cake</li>
            <li>Blueberry Cake</li>
            <li>Espresso Bean Cake</li>
            <li>Korean Sweet Potato Cake</li>
            <li>Cookies- Chocolate Chip, Butter, Butter Pecan, Peanut Butter, Espresso Bean, Snowball, Sugar, Cinnamon Sugar, Matcha White Chocolate, Chcolate with Marshmallow Filling, Sprinkle</li>
            <li>Bread- French Brioche, Sourdough, Milk bread, Flatbread</li>
            <li>Pound Cake</li>
            <li>Cupcakes- Vanilla, Chocolate</li>
            <li>Cream Puffs</li>
            <li>Macaroons</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <h2>
            Sewing
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            For many years, I struggled in finding clothes that I liked and fit me properly. As someone on the shorter and smaller side, my size was in between a kid's XL to an adult's XS. It was especially hard when it came to dress shopping. So, in Fall 2023, I taught myself sewing. I had basic knowledge of hand sewing from elementary school, but in order to do bigger projects, I needed to learn how to use the sewing machine. I also learned to take my own measurements, make my own designs, and about various types of fabrics that fit different projects.

            Sports

        <br>
        <p>
            I have always enjoyed sports and like to challenge myself to try new sports. So far, I have done the following sports:
            <ul>
                <li>Ballet</li>
                <li>Swimming</li>
                <li>Soccer</li>
                <li>Tennis</li>
                <li>Kendo</li>
                <li>Taekwondo</li>
                <li>Volleyball</li>
                <li>Gymnastics</li>
                <li>Fencing</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Most recently, I started learning MMA- kickboxing, wrestling, and judo during Summer 2024 as well as dance (Fall 2024).
