            <h2>
                CROCHET/KNITTING
            </h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I started knitting in 5th grade after receiving a knitting kit from Santa Claus! I started with scarves, beanies, and clothes for my dog. In high school, I transitioned to crochet and made myself clothes and other home decor. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My first project with knitting was a scarf for a family friend. I don't know why I chose such a long project as my first because I struggled
                a lot. I remember my scarf had many random holes and I couldn't figure out why. I restarted so many times but at the end,
                there were still a couple holes I missed. My next knitting project was a large American flag for my history class. Again, I don't know
                how I thought I could accomplish it in a short amount of time. I wasn't able to. But I got help from a family friend and I was able to submit it
                on time. When starting new hobbies, I always bit off more than I could chew, especially when I was younger. But eventually, I learned my lesson
                and took on more easier projects that allowed me to work on my foundations before tackling larger projects. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Another factor that hindered my growth during the beginning stages was that I tried to make my own patterns without even knowing knitting that well.
                Whenever I did any activity that had to do with making something, I never looked at pre-existing patterns but tried to make my own. I wanted everything 
                that I made unique and only one in the entire world. I was too cocky in the beginning, but I think the trial and error helped me to recognize how to make things
                without a pattern easier. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I didn't knit/crochet throughout late middle to early high school. COVID-19 was when I picked up knitting again and also learned crochet. Even after COVID, 
                I rarely picked up the needle. It wasn't until coming to college that I started knitting/crocheting more consistently. With limited things to do in my dorm, 
                I turned to knitting/crochet to fill up my free time. I love knitting/crocheting and still do it consistently. Recently, I have been obsessed with fiberfill 
                and am experimenting with making crocheted stuffed animals!

            <h2>
                BAKING
            </h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Just like many others, I picked up baking seriously during COVID. With my mother's birthday during the peak of COVID, I decided to surprise her with her favorite Korean-style cake as the area I lived in did not have many Asians or Asian goods. Since then, I started experimenting with other recipes while also researching the chemical background of baking to make my own recipes. The following is everything I have baked so far:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fresh Strawberry Whipped Cream Cake</li>
                    <li>Tiramisu Cake</li>
                    <li>Italian Tiramisu Cake with Ladyfingers</li>
                    <li>Chocolate Cake</li>
                    <li>Carrot Cake</li>
                    <li>Blueberry Cake</li>
                    <li>Espresso Bean Cake</li>
                    <li>Korean Sweet Potato Cake</li>
                    <li>Cookies- Chocolate Chip, Butter, Butter Pecan, Peanut Butter, Espresso Bean, Snowball, Sugar, Cinnamon Sugar, Matcha White Chocolate, Chcolate with Marshmallow Filling, Sprinkle</li>
                    <li>Bread- French Brioche, Sourdough, Milk bread, Flatbread</li>
                    <li>Pound Cake</li>
                    <li>Cupcakes- Vanilla, Chocolate</li>
                    <li>Cream Puffs</li>
                    <li>Macaroons</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Baking was my main activity during my free time in high school. It helped me relieve stress and gives me great satisfaction when 
                I see my family and friends enjoy what I baked. If I had to choose, I would say that my specialty is cake. I specifically make all my cakes with Whipped
                cream frosting- the key difference between Korean and American cakes. My favorite part of baking a cake is decorating. I love using different piping tips 
                to create different designs. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I wanted to elevate my cakes more and found the perfect solution recently. While I was in Korea, I visited lots of cake stores because I love looking
                at other people's creations and came across the cutest cake toppers! Without much piping needed, having just one cake topper made the cake so much more 
                unique, elegant, and fun! So I ordered cake toppers. I also ordered more piping tools for more complicated flower piping. So now, I have all these and cake pans 
                in my dorm waiting to be used soon...

                SEWING
            </h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                For many years, I struggled in finding clothes that I liked and fit me properly. As someone on the shorter and smaller side, 
                my size was in between a kid's XL to an adult's XS. It was especially hard when it came to dress shopping. So, in Fall 2023, 
                I taught myself sewing. I had basic knowledge of hand sewing from elementary school, but in order to do bigger projects, I 
                needed to learn how to use the sewing machine. I learned the basics of how a sewing machine works and got right to designing. 
                I refused to use a pre-existing pattern because 1. I want my own unique dress for my last teen birthday and 2. the whole reason 
                I started was because standard sizing doesn't fit me anyways. Because it was my first project, I tested my design out on test (muslin) 
                fabric first and after making slight alterations, I got to work on the real dress. It took me a long time. I was too afraid of messing up 
                and wanted everything perfect- down to each pin. I was actually very happy with the final result! There was only one thing I wished I had 
                done differently, but other than that, I was very satisfied. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Since then, I felt more confident about my projects. I also loved that I could just make anything according to my preferences at any given time. 
                I made my halloween costume right before halloween, I fixed the length/waist/size of any pre-existing clothes I had, I cut up clothes I don't like 
                to make new outfits, etc. I also could make home decor like cushions according to the exact color, design, and size I wanted without having to search around
                stores for my ideal cushion. Sewing is honestly one of the most useful hobbies I have picked up and am very eager to improve!

                I have always enjoyed sports and like to try out new sports. So far, I have done the following sports:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ballet</li>
                    <li>Swimming</li>
                    <li>Soccer</li>
                    <li>Tennis</li>

                    <li>Taekwondo</li>
                    <li>Volleyball</li>

                Most recently, I started learning MMA- kickboxing, wrestling, and judo during Summer 2024 as well as dance (Fall 2024). 
                I started attending a MMA academy in South Korea during my study abroad in South Korea. I attended practice 3 days a week
                and enjoyed it a lot. There were barely any girls learning MMA, so my practice partners were mostly elementary to middle 
                school boys. I wish I could have attended the academy longer. It was truly the highlight of my day. This was the first new sport
                I have done in a while so I felt very weak and did end up spraining my ankle, but it was so worth it. I hope I can continue 
                so I can fight against adults!
